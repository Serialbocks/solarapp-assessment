Overview: Your task is to review an applicable section of the electrical code (NEC 200, section 705.11a) and draft a machine-readable interpretation of this code. We don’t expect you to perfectly interpret the code; this will be a first draft that we can then discuss with you during our onsite interview. Please take no more than 4 hours to complete the task; we expect that it will take between 1-2 hours. Document your work however you like. Please send in your documented response at least 24 hours prior to your scheduled interview time. 

Specifics: 

We’ve attached screenshots of section 705.11 (and other relevant sections) of NEC code. Review the sections and their external references. We’d like you to draft machine readable code analyzing whether a solar photovoltaic system, with or without energy storage, is compliant with Section 705.11(A). You should: 


Identify and document all of the variables you’ll need to extract

Write pseudo code describing the checks you’d want to make. 

Come prepared to walk through your process and the work you did with Dan and Mark.
